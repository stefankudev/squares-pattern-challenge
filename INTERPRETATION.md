# Interpretation

My understanding of the task at hand is to create a function which takes in one argument of `N: number`, where `N` is a number between `0` and `9` which: 
- Fills a 10x10 grid starting from the bottom left corner
- It fills the grid with blue and red squares
- The squares are positioned in such a way that the blue squares appear in a pattern that is diagonal (from top left to bottom right)
- Each row (starting from bottom to top) is only filled (from left to right) with a number of squares equal to the row number
    - Assuming the rows are ordered from 1 to 10 (from bottom to top)
