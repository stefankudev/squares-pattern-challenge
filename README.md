# squares-pattern-challenge

This is an attempt at **an unnamed squares pattern challenge**, where no explicit prompt or instruction is given, other than the image in [assets/squares-pattern-challenge.jpg](assets/squares-pattern-challenge.jpg).

My interpretation of the task at hand is detailed in [INTERPRETATION.md](INTERPRETATION.md).

Enjoy!
